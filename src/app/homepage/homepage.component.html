        <p class="lead">Cooking is the process of preparing food for consumption by applying various techniques, such as heating, seasoning, and combining ingredients to create dishes that are not only safe to eat but also delicious and appealing to the senses. It is considered both an art and a science, as it involves creativity, skill, and knowledge of ingredients, cooking methods, and flavor profiles. .</p>
